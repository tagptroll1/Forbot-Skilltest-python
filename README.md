# FotMob-Skilltest-python


This solution scales a little better.
Initially I wanted to just work with  the strings without parsing all the numbers, but figured python handles huge sets of numbers really well.
Much of the data is lazy loaded with iterators, ranges and duplicates are removed using Sets.


script can be run without any dependencies.
I used python 3.9, incase there are any issues running the code.
A Pipfile is included to setup the same environment
